This directory is used to store product customizers.

Each customizer should be stored as a folder.  The folder should be named
based on the product_customizers.name value from the database.

Each folder can contain these items:

  - product.php (Required)
	Contains the CustomProductTemplate-based class that handles rendering the
	customizer, verifying input, etc.
	This class should ALWAYS be called "CustomProduct"

	This class should also handle the AJAX calls!

  - custom.js
	Contains any JavaScript needed for this customizer. (auto-included)

  - custom.css
	Contains any custom CSS needed for this customizer. (auto-included)

  - images/*
	Contains any unique images needed for this customizer.

Beyond this, anything else within the folder can be loaded using the url format:

site_url('customize/product/<<pid>>/files/<relative/path/to/item>');

This will look for an item in /relative/path/to/, under the product folder.
It will attempt to return the item with the correct mimetype.
